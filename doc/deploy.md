# Deployment with Domain Name and Let's Encrypt Certificates

The following instructions assume a fixed IP and domain name for the server to be `cyclone.meling.me`.
Replace the relevant IP address and domain name with your own.

## Configure Fixed IP and Router

In your domain name provider, configure your IP and domain name; for instance:

```text
Type         Host          Value                TTL
A Record     cyclone       92.221.105.172       5 min
```

Set up port forwarding on your router.
External ports 80/443/8080 maps to internal ports 80/443/8080 for TCP.

## Install Tools for Deployment

This assumes you have homebrew installed.
For systems without homebrew, the make target should list well-known packages available on most Unix distributions.

```sh
% make brew
```

## Install Tools for Development

The development tools are only needed for development, and can be skipped for deployment only.
To install:

```sh
% make devtools
```

The `devtools` make target will download and install various Protobuf compiler plugins and the grpcweb Protobuf compiler.

## Generate Certbot Private Key and Certificate

```terminal
% sudo certbot certonly --standalone

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:

   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/cyclone.meling.me/privkey.pem
   Your certificate will expire on 2021-09-11. To obtain a new or
   tweaked version of this certificate in the future, simply run
   certbot again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your
   certificates, run "certbot renew"
```

## Configuring Docker

To ensure that Docker containers has access to networking, you may need to set up IPv4 port forwarding on your server machine:

```sh
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sudo sysctl -p
sudo service docker restart
```

## Run Envoy

### TODO make docker image with both envoy and quickfeed and expose ports needed etc

```sh
% brew install tmux overmind 
% Procfile
```

### Generate Envoy Configuration File

```sh
% cd $QUICKFEED
% cp doc/scripts/envs.sh quickfeed-env.sh
# Edit quickfeed-env.sh according to your domain
% source quickfeed-env.sh
% make envoy-config
```

Note that you may need to disable NGINX on Ubuntu:

```sh
# Temporarily stop running NGINX
% sudo systemctl stop nginx
# Permanently disable NGINX
% sudo systemctl disable nginx
```

### Running with Locally Installed Envoy (macOS homebrew)

```sh
% sudo envoy -c $ENVOY_CONFIG &
```

With additional logging:

```sh
% sudo envoy -c $ENVOY_CONFIG --log-path envoy.log --enable-fine-grain-logging -l debug &
```

### Running with func-e (Linux)

Install the `func-e` command in `/usr/local/bin` with:

```sh
% curl https://func-e.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

Alternatively, install via linuxbrew instead:

```sh
% brew install func-e
% sudo ln -s /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/func-e /usr/local/bin
```

Run with:

```sh
% sudo func-e run -c $ENVOY_CONFIG &
```

### Running Envoy via Docker Image

```sh
% docker pull envoyproxy/envoy:v1.19.0
% docker run --rm envoyproxy/envoy:v1.19.0 -c $ENVOY_CONFIG
```

## Configure GitHub OAuth Application for QuickFeed

To deploy QuickFeed, you need to configure a GitHub account for communicating with QuickFeed.
See the instructions for configuring a [GitHub OAuth2 application](./github.md).

For this tutorial, we use the following:

```text
Homepage URL: https://cyclone.meling.me
Authorization callback URL: https://cyclone.meling.me/auth/github/callback
```

## Build and Run QuickFeed Server

After editing files in the `public` folder, run the following command.
This should also work while the application is running.

```bash
% make ui
```

Build and run the `quickfeed` server; here we use all default values:

```bash
% go install
% quickfeed -service.url $DOMAIN  &> quickfeed.log &
```

### Troubleshooting

If `go install` fails with the following (on Ubuntu):

```sh
cgo: exec gcc-5: exec: "gcc-5": executable file not found in $PATH
```

Then run and retry `go install`:

```bash
% brew install gcc@5
% go install
```

## Running the QuickFeed Server Details

The following provides additional details for running QuickFeed.
Before running the QuickFeed server, you need to configure [GitHub](./github.md).

The command line arguments for the QuickFeed server looks roughly like this:

```sh
quickfeed -service.url <DNS name of deployed service> -database.file <path to database> -http.addr <HTTP listener address>
```

To view the full usage details:

```sh
quickfeed -help
```

Here is an example with all default values:

```sh
quickfeed -service.url uis.itest.run &> quickfeed.log &
```

*As a bootstrap mechanism, the first user to sign in, automatically becomes administrator for the system.*

### Flags

| **Flag**        | **Description**                        | **Example**     |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `service.url`   | Base DNS name for QuickFeed deployment | `uis.itest.run` |
| `database.file` | Path to QuickFeed database             | `qf.db`         |
| `grpc.addr`     | Listener address for gRPC service      | `:9090`         |
| `http.addr`     | Listener address for HTTP service      | `:3005`         |
| `http.public`   | Path to service content                | `public`        |

### Custom Docker Image for a Course

QuickFeed will pull publicly available docker images from Docker Hub on demand.
However, you may create custom docker images locally on your QuickFeed server machine, and use these locally only.
That is, you don't need to upload your custom image to Docker Hub or elsewhere.

To prepare a new custom Docker image for a course, prepare the relevant `Dockerfile` and build it.
The `quickfeed-go` make target gives an example:

```sh
make quickfeed-go
```
